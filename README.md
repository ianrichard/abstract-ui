# Abstract UI

## Overview

This is a WIP project I just started that will explore the viability of creating an API-driven configuration via JS or JSON for generating user interfaces vs explicitly coding them with React or any other framework.

Nothin much made yet. I'll update when ready.

## How to Run

```terminal
git clone git@github.com:ianrichard/abstract-ui.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Thanks

Thanks to who made the [react-webpack-babel](https://github.com/ReactJSResources/react-webpack-babel) lightweight boilerplate project I used as a starting point for this project. This also has Sass hooked up, so was exactly what I was looking for.
